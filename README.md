# Kyle's script 

This script gathers the first 100 posts on hackernews and confirms they are sorted from newest (at the top) to oldest (at the bottom).
Further, it outputs all of the relevant information about each post into the console, and also displays how many posts there were per minute.

The bones of a react frontend exist here, it is under construction.
